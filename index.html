<p>I am Jake Leyhr, a developmental biologist interested in a range of topics 
 from the development of complex tissue interactions to the early evolution of vertebrates. I am
  currently a Postdoctoral Associate at Duke University (USA) studying cell invasion in nematode worms.
  Before that, I completed my PhD at Uppsala University (Sweden), where I examined the role and regulation of key genes 
  patterning the cartilage, bone, and connective tissues of zebrafish.</p>
