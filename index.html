<p>I am Jake Leyhr, an evolutionary developmental biologist interested in a range of topics 
  from the early evolution of vertebrates to musculoskeletal development. I recently completed 
  my PhD at Uppsala University in Sweden, where I examined the role and regulation of key genes 
  patterning the cartilage, bone, and connective tissues of zebrafish.</p>
