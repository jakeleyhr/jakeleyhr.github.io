### Musculoskeletal development
Vertebrate musculoskeletal development is driven by complex genetic networks that regulate the formation of cartilage, bone, and connective tissues. My PhD research focused on how key developmental genes, such as _nkx3.2_, _gdf5_, and _mkx_, influence skeletal and soft tissue patterning in zebrafish. Using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate gene mutants, I comprehensively examined the phenotypic consequences of disrupting these genes, revealing their roles in shaping skeletal elements like joints, vertebrae, and fin radials. I also investigated the regulatory regions that control their expression, identifying conserved enhancers that govern gene activity during crucial stages of tissue development. This work connected gene function to structural development, enhancing our understanding of the genetic foundations of the vertebrate skeleton.

### 3D morphology and histology
In my PhD research I made extensive use of X-ray computed tomography (CT) technologies, ranging from commercial microCT to advanced propagation phase contrast synchrotron radiation microCT at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France. I generated high-resolution 3D datasets (down to the submicron scale) of fixed whole organisms and dissected tissues from various species, often enhanced with iodine staining to increase contrast between soft tissues. This allowed me to reconstruct detailed 3D morphologies and examine 2D histological features from any perspective at near-cellular resolution. For example, I mapped the facial musculature and Weberian ligaments of juvenile zebrafish in relation to their bony skeleton, and precisely quantified chondrocyte populations within cartilage structures. I also scanned ancient fossil fishes at the ESRF to gain insights into their bone and cartilage morphology and histology and compare them with living species.
