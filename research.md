### 3D morphology and histology
I've been fortunate to have accessed X-ray computed tomography (CT) scanning technologies, from commercial microCT machines to propagation phase contrast synchrotron radiation microCT beamtime at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France. These scans produce 3D datasets down to submicron resolution of fixed whole larvae and dissected samples from a range of species, often stained with iodine to enhance the contrast between tissues. I can then reconstruct the 3D morphology of any tissue(s), and visualise the 2D histology of the tissue from any angle with cellular resolution. For example, I've described the facial musculature and Weberian ligaments of juvenile zebrafish in relation to the bony skeleton, and counted the individual chondrocytes in cartilage elements.
